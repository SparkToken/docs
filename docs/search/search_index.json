Centralized attention merchants like Google and Facebook \u200bhave harvested user data to amass enormous wealth, concentrating power among a few corporations while new players are virtually unable to compete without access to the vast troves of user data they own. Google and Facebook have become two of the biggest companies in the world, monetizing their user data and attention to claim over 73% of online digital ad revenue, and 99% of all growth from 2015-16 of total online ad budget in the US. Pivotal Research\u2019s Jay Weiser has said the digital-media industry has effectively become a giant duopoly in which Google and Facebook win almost everything, advertisers have to play by their rules, and other media companies \u201cfight for the scraps.\u201d  \n\n\nAlong with their personal data, users also give up their privacy as their data is sliced and diced in walled gardens that often lack transparency. The platforms have left common users powerless to control access to their own data and unable to extract much of the value they create. The power concentrated in a few platforms also expose societies to problems inadvertently created by those ecosystems. We have seen this firsthand as politicians take advantage of the power and reach of social networks, with the resulting spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Trump as our first \u201cAttention President.\u201d\n\n\nMission statement\n\n\nWe envision a new open, transparent technology ecosystem whose goals are aligned with that of the users. We want to help build a movement for consumers to take back control of their digital lives by owning their own data and simply licensing it to attention merchants and developers. The people must demand this change and perhaps incumbent companies may follow suit and help revert the collateral damage that has taken place due to the advent of these attention merchants.\n\n\nDecentralized personal data ownership\n\n\nThe recent adoption of smart contracts in blockchain has allowed for something not possible before: a decentralized and verifiable accounting of digital asset ownership.\n\n\nInstead of your personal data being stored on centralized servers and owned by centralized corporations, imagine your \nencrypted\n personal data being stored on a decentralized computer network, being owned by you, and you monetize your own data by licensing it interested parties such as software companies.\n\n\nWith software companies licensing your personal data, they get value by geting to know you instantly and skipping much of the costly onboarding process. Through the Spark API, they get a comprehensive real-time profile about you and your preferences to give you a better and more relevant experience on their apps. \n\n\nAnd if those companies obtain information about you that is not already in Spark, those companies can contribute that missing data to Spark and earn incentives from the Spark reward system. This way, every participant, whether its you or subscribed app companies, can help build the a comprehensive source-of-truth about you, and data is owned and monetizable by you.\n\n\nAnd when you update your profile and preferences in Spark, those subscribed apps get real-time updates about your changes.
